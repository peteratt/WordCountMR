Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough

birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry

their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something

and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights

everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.

the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.

with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something

"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.

been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.

pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"But lovely!" he cried.

birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's

And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.

up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit

She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's

I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough

birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry

their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something

and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights

everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.

the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.

with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something

"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the
end where the Morels lived there were not many young things.
So the few were more united. Boys and girls played together,
the girls joining in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking
part in the dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.

Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,
when it was not wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers
were all gone home, till it was thick dark, and the street would
be deserted. Then they tied their scarves round their necks,
for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers' children did,
and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the whole
great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby.
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post,
which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation.
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp,
turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the
dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
and a long-legged girl came flying up.

"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"

"I don't know."

But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.
Then the play went fast and furious.

There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop
of darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,
dark way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came
out of this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen
yards the night had swallowed them. The children played on.

They were brought exceedingly close together owing to
their isolation. If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse.
Then Paul had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,
while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back
him up. Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,
and flee home in terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierce
internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,
between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird.
And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins.
And then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,
surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,
would hear the children singing away:

"My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk."

They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:

"I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.

"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.
His sudden rages rather amused her.

"I'm NOT going any more," he declared.

"Oh, very well, tell your father so."

He chewed his bun as if he hated it.

"I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money."

"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough
of the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.

This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying
birthday presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it.
But---

"They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."

"Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME
about it."

"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,
and I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'
Mr. Winterbottom says 'You was'."

"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.

The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes
dark and furious. His mother moved
about at her work, taking no notice of him.

"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,"
he said.

"Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.

"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you
at the Board-school?'"

"They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact--
neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born with."

So, in her own way, she soothed him.
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her
heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

"What was the cheque?" she asked.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen
and six stoppages," replied the boy. "It's a good week;
and only five shillings stoppages for my father."

So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.

Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.
So the boy remained alone.

Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran
in from surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,
the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men
everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with
her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey,
but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was
a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she
was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she
was coldly polite.

"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.

"Sevenpence to you."

"Thank you."

She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave
the market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots
lay coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,
pretending not to.

She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.
Her bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."

"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.
"And I'm sure it's right enough."

It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was
reduced to black lace and a bit of jet.

"It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give
it a pick-me-up?"

"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.

She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,
the pot man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something
between them. Suddenly he shouted:

"Do you want it for fivepence?"

She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took
up her dish.

"I'll have it," she said.

"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit
in it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."

Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.

"I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."

"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky
if you can give your things away," he growled.

"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.

But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends.
She dare now finger his pots. So she was happy.

Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She
was always her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,
feeling rich in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry
and looked up from his drawing.

"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.

"My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.

"I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.
SUCH a weight!"

She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.

"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.

"The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look,
I've not forgotten it."

"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.
"You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's
quite so bad."

"Don't you?"

The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little
black bonnet.

"No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody's
cry alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable."

"It would ME," said Paul.

"Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how much
do you think he let me have THIS for?"

She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood
looking on it with joy.

"Show me!" said Paul.

The two stood together gloating over the dish.

"I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.

"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---"

"One and three," said Paul.

"Fivepence!"

"It's not enough, mother."

"No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd
been extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't
have let me have it if he hadn't wanted to."

"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.

"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.

"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.

"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.

Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

"It's done," he said, giving it to her.

She tapped it also.

"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm
a wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."

He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of
pansies and of crimson daisies.

"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.

"How CHEAP!" he cried.

"Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."

"But lovely!" he cried.

"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.
"Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an
old man!"

"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice!
But he's a bit splashed."

He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully
washed the pansy.

"NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.

"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.
