of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can

but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply

mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.

can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.

of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I

can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read

only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like

"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life.

He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.

and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.

the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'

she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.

she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?

But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year

aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks

There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,

intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,

dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can

fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can

This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply

mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked

She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.

she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much

you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained

forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed

living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with

was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two

the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.

the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,

William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'

she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played

heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear

There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.

All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into

could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,

one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can

fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can

This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply

mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked

She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.

she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much

you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained

forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed

living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with

was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two

the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.

the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,

William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'

she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played

heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear

There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.

All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into

could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,

one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

That was another time when the family suffered intensely.
The children came from school and had their teas. On the hob
the big black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,
ready for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But for
months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.

In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,
Mrs. Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a
tallow candle to save the gas. The children finished their
bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.
But if Morel had not come they faltered. The sense of his sitting
in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming
of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.

William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.
He was studying hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be
fretting him. Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.
He did not drink. The children were all rabid teetotallers.
He came home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.
His mother implored him to take more care, to do one thing
or another.

"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN
study on top of all. You can't; the human frame won't
stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse yourself or learn Latin;
but don't try to do both."

Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.
This seemed a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to
rejoice or to grieve.

"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried,
his eyes blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything
go silent inside her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply
by Thursday whether you accept. Yours faithfully---' They want me,
mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me.
Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London! And I
can give you twenty pounds a year, mater. We s'll all be rolling
in money."

"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.

It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going
away than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for
his departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.
Almost she lived by him. She liked to do things for him: she liked
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was
so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.
There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure
of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away.
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.

A few days before his departure--he was just twenty--he burned his
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard.
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them
she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

Now, on the Saturday morning he said:

"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can
have the birds and flowers."

Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday,
because he was having a last day's holiday. She was making him
a rice cake, which he loved, to take with him. He was scarcely
conscious that she was so miserable.

He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted,
and had purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

"Nice scent! Smell."

And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

"Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."

His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.

"I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.

"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.
He owns property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I
know French. 'You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me.
'I told mother about you this morning, and she will have much
pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get
father's consent also. I sincerely hope he will agree. I will let
you know how it transpires. If, however, you---'"

"'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.

"'Transpires'--oh yes!"

"'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought
she was so well educated!"

William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,
giving Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read
extracts from his letters, some of which amused his mother,
some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him.

"My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've
only got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like
a dog that has its head scratched."

"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.
"And when they've done, I trot away."

"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you
can't pull off," she answered.

"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't
flatter themselves."

"You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.

Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or
forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows
and forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London,
to start a new life. 

PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.
His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with
a full, dropping underlip.

As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious
of what other people felt, particularly his mother. When she
fretted he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemed
always attentive to her.

As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far
removed from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy
belonged at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a
"flybie-skybie", as her mother called her. But she was intensely
fond of her second brother. So Paul was towed round at the heels
of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at lerky with the other
young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,
living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own.
He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.

She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not
so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with
an antimacassar, to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul
must practise jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash into
the face of the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,
and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.

"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it
was there," he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for
the doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out.
She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or two
afterwards she was shocked.

"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."

She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see
what the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of
the shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into
the hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing
alight. He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off
the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame.
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the arms
and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.

"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm
glad there's nothing left of her."

Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.

All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly
against their father, along with their mother. Morel continued
to bully and to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when he
made the whole life of the family a misery. Paul never forgot
coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing
on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and William,
just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.

William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.
He waited until the children were silent, watching with children's
rage and hate; then he said:

"You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."

But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son.
William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

"Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o'
thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.
Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?"

Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,
almost beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the
last time, though."

Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist
to strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into his
blue eyes, almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,
and the men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would.
The three children sat pale on the sofa.

"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.
"We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,"
she said, turning on to her husband, "look at your children!"

Morel glanced at the sofa.

"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.
"Why, what have I done to the children, I should like to know?
But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and
nasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."

She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he
threw his boots under the table and went to bed.

"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William,
when his father was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."

"A nice thing--your own father," she replied.

"'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"

"Well, he is--and so---"

"But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."

"The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."

"No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself.
WHY didn't you let me give it him?"

"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,"
she cried quickly.

And the children went to bed, miserably.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,
which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it.
In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,
sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,
and the tree shrieked again. Morel liked it.

"It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."

But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became
almost a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year
in the new house their father was very bad. The children played
in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight
o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below.
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children
a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came
in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord.
Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he
heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children
lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear
what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again.
There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness,
and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an
intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.
All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.
And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere,
outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood?
What had he done?

The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs
in his stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,
if the wind allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into
the kettle, which their mother was filling for morning, and they
could go to sleep in peace.

So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of
the darkness. But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.

Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.

"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my
father die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit,"
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.
