cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.

You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."

silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

almost seems to hurt you."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh

Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got

her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.

in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback

he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.

had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then

of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time

But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels

His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

on to the table.

Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.

kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted

He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet

again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then

with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.

for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels

But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.

and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"

cripple instruments, and so on. Through her Miriam felt she got
into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better
Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,
and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
It interested Paul.

Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man
of thirty-one or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's
corner--a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.
He had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hair
was of soft brown, his moustache was golden. And he had a similar
defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference.
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.
They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a
way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him--perhaps because he really disapproved
of himself.

From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.

"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind
the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,
with a kind of rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,
critical gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round as if he
had been stung.

"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.

The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"Why yer---!" shouted Dawes.

"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't
help it."

Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time
he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away
before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated
each other in silence.

Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the
home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother.
Dawes lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and
somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman.
She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet
flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home.

The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,
so the two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room.
There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was
on the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high old
rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,
she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warm
on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.

"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.

"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.

"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said,
in a deep tone,

"Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her
for some things. IS she disagreeable?"

"I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."

"What with?"

"Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"

"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions
so soon?"

"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.

"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her
to match him," he said.

Miriam bowed her head.

"Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"

"Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setback
of her throat---" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.

Miriam bowed a little lower.

"Yes," she said.

There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.

"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.

"I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciate
her as an artist, that's all."

"Yes."

He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way.
It irritated him.

"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.

She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.

"I do," she said.

"You don't--you can't--not really."

"Then what?" she asked slowly.

"Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
against men."

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.

deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,

That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking
Mrs. Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent.
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was
becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.
She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemed
the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.

There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.

"If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would
you look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"

She laughed with a naked, painful sound.

"I don't know," she said.

His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

"Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter.
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it
almost seems to hurt you."

She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.

"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just
for one minute. I feel as if it would set something free."

"But"--and she looked up at him with eyes frightened
and struggling--"I do laugh at you--I DO."

"Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh
I could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.
Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."

Slowly she shook her head despairingly.

"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.

"I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.

She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear
him in two.

"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels
like a disembodied spirit then."

There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness
between them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his
eyes gone dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want
to be spiritual."

She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked
up at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so.
But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way.
And she yearned to him.

He gave a brief laugh.

"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine."

"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.
And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands
looked so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then
be dared not--or could not. There was something prevented him.
His kisses were wrong for her. They continued the reading till ten
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly
again with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;
there was a kind of fascination about him.

When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front
wheel punctured.

"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.
"I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it."

He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up
the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl
of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see
his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kind
of easiness even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work
he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted
to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him,
so long as he did not want her.

"There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done
it quicker?"

"No!" she laughed.

He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put
her two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.

"You are so FINE!" she said.

He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave
of flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this.
He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.

He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.

"That's all right!" he said.

She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.

"Did you have them mended?" she asked.

"No!"

"But why didn't you?"

"The back one goes on a bit."

"But it's not safe."

"I can use my toe."

"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.

"Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."

"Shall we?"

"Do--about four. I'll come to meet you."

"Very well."

She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate.
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.
It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black
in front.

"Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.

"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.

"Yes."

His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground.
She turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,
his dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world
was full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle
in their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night.
When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got
home safely.

He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,
so he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged
over the second, steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said.
It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom,
and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.
Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to
deprive her altogether.

The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,
silver upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long
climb home.

"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves
on to the table.

"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.
She sat reading, alone, as she always did.

"Aren't they pretty?"
