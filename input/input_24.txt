It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally

He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants

in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious

of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching

rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow

yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.

was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could

friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down

a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.

with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,

and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.

It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down

more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village

for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the

But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I

but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.

plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.

to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down

"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching

and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country

Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.

But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.

There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he

a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally

and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.

Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants

something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.

"I do not," replied his mother.

"He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I
shouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a game
of whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quite
proprietously--and so can't get home. He's a fool."

"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.

"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.

They went on with breakfast.

"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.

"What do you ask that for?"

"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."

"She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me."

"And you'd actually rather he was good?"

"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."

Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often.
It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his
mother debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished
cottage for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,
but he insisted on two.

At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation.
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would have
a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it
would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam.
She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rang
with excitement.

They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it
was so far for her to walk. She came down for supper.
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight.
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,
and so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far in
the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family.
But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa
absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,
when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair.
She was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,
Morel with his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening
to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head
over the book. He had got now all the audience he cared for.
And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen
best and win his favour. He was in very high feather.

"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby'
that the bells are supposed to ring?"

"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning
against water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,"
he replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,
but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk.
They listened and believed him. He believed himself.

"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.

"Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o'
the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."

"How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung
backwards or forwards."

"But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up
to the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!"

He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought
so too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.

"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."

"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,"
said Morel.

There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

Miriam rose to help with the pots.

"Let ME help to wash up," she said.

"Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again.
There aren't many."

And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down
again to look at the book with Paul.

He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby
instead of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.
His bold little mother did that.

"Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"

Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.

"Two shillings."

"Why, how far is it?"

"A good way."

"I don't believe it," she said.

But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old
seaside carriage.

"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each,
and if it were a tramcar---"

They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

"Is it this? Now, this is it!"

Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was
a universal sigh.

"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.
"I WAS frightened." They drove on and on.

At last they descended at a house that stood alone over
the dyke by the highroad. There was wild excitement because they
had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.
But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow
on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley,
yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching
level to the sky.

Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show.
The total expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings
a week per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings.
Morel was wandering abroad quite early.

"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece
of bread-and-butter."

"All right," he answered.

And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at
the breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband
was blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed
the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.

"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now
you work."

"Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"

He loved to go with her across the fields to the village
and the sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her
for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.

Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the
others went to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam,
so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly
to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too,
knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
Yet to Annie he said:

"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."

It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight
chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn.
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,
even when it was:

"Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me."

Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at
the "Coons", she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky
and land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,
just as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven and
touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,
was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.

One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore
of sand towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran
in a hiss of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening.
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,
no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clanging
at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of it
and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him.
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they
turned again. The way home was through a gap in the sandhills,
and then along a raised grass road between two dykes. The country
was black and still. From behind the sandhills came the whisper
of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly he started.
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and he could
scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.

"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.

He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.
His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.

"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.

He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever
in shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching
him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeply
moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent
against it. His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest.
But he could not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood.
But somehow she ignored them. She was expecting some religious
state in him. Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,
and gazed at him, troubled.

"What is it?" she murmured again.

"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.

"Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious
about him. The crisis was past.

He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.
He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank
in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon
and did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she
seemed in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he saw
the one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.

"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother
as they entered.

"What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk
if I like, can't I?"

"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.

"I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE.
I shall do as I like."

"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like."
And she took no further notice of him that evening. Which he
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.
Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her
for making her son like this. She watched Paul growing irritable,
priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame on Miriam.
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam had no
friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
because she despised the triviality of these other people.

And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease
and naturalness. And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation. 

ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance
of getting on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drink
nor gamble. Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,
always through some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he went
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive
into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass
of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.

He had not been at his work many months when again he did
not come home one night.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.
