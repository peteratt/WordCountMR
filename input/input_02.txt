civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.

But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened

So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,

civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.

and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak

or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock

more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted

and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,

rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,

from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.

determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,

he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,

He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.

and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,

thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to

the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall

to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching

In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to

his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,

a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged

without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,

hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,

a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged

without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,

hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,

a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged

without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,

hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,

a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged

without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.

The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?"
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered.
Yet he was usually indulgent to them.

Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank
more noisily than he had need. No one spoke to him. The family
life withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.
But he cared no longer about his alienation.

Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened
Mrs. Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,
heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,
as he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,
lacing his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.
He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his own
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said
so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's got."
The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
had gone, they sighed with relief.

He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a
rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened
forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone
black with wet. The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full
of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed
over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,
if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer
and smoke.

"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel
appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"

The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad.
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,
all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded
his wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,
and looked inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,
and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,
and went out.

The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked
in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes.
Then she sat down and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't
spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"

She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it.
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her
husband had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money
she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.
He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,
and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse.
So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he
had not paid back.

This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--
he came home early that day--she said to him coldly:

"Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"

"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna!
I niver clapped eyes on your purse."

But she could detect the lie.

"Why, you know you did," she said quietly.

"I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer?
I've had about enough on't."

"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking
the clothes in."

"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his
chair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went
determinedly upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,
and with a big bundle in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.
civilly to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,
and made them hate him.

On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,
tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

"I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.

The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was
too tired to carry him to the cradle.

"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.
"It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.

She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she
could not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,
he lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched
at the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat
bowed over the child.

"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently,
as if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he
affected the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel
hated him most in this condition.

"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly,
it sounded impersonal.

He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.

"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,"
he said affectedly.

"And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.

He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward.
He leaned on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked
at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he
pulled sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew
out bodily, and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,
splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.
The baby gave a little convulsed start.

"What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.

"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up,
like other women have to, an' wait on a man."

"Wait on you--wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."

"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha
sh'lt wait on me---"

"Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."

"What--what?"

He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech
be turned round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.
He stared at her one silent second in threat.

"P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.

He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.

One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer
crashed into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from
her chair. To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child
tightly to her bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,
she brought herself to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her left
brow was bleeding rather profusely. As she glanced down at the child,
her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;
but the baby was at least not hurt. She balanced her head to
keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.

Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with
one hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

"Did it catch thee?"

He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance.

"Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.

He hiccoughed. "Let's--let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.

"Go away!" she cried.

"Lemme--lemme look at it, lass."

She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.

"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.

He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she
bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy.
Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,
trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.

Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,
for the scattered spoons.

Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came
craning his neck towards her.

"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,
humble tone.

"You can see what it's done," she answered.

He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped
his legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound.
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,
averting her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,
who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,
he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak
through to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it
soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.

"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.
But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened:
"Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.

He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,
as she sat with the baby on her lap.

"Now that clean pit-scarf."

Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently
with a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers
proceeded to bind it round her head.

"Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.

"I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she
went upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I
was getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out."
Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.
They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the
unconscious tragedy they felt.

Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He
did not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought
of anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like
a sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged
because he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow.
He tried to wriggle out of it. "It was her own fault," he said
to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,
and which he could only alleviate by drinking.

He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,
or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself
violent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose,
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,
then pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock
slightly tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.
He rose again at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.

Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till
2.30, dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,
he was fast asleep. She would have felt sorry for him, if he
had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself
it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she merely left
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
and she was stronger.

The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat
down to meals together.

"Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.

"Let him lie," the mother replied.

There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him all his life. He was all for activity.
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.

It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again.
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.
