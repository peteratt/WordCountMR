A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up

and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper

self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper

and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.

He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper

like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton

He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper

and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt

self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,

or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.

his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he

sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,

Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel

and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,

family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.

Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole

or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was

There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;

was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a

And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything

When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.

four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?

I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.

I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly

poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,

'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would

'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a

They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."

him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded

But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its

in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.

And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll

And he looked at me. It seems hard."

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the

realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,

when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's

to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,

on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver

watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,

hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular

I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.

wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,

he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,

all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must

he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.

"Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"

But she had guessed already.

"Your mester's got hurt," he said.

"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.
And what's he done this time?"

"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein'
'im ter th' 'ospital."

"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is!
There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is!
His thumb's nearly better, and now--- Did you see him?"

"I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in
a tub, an' 'e wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink
when Doctor Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an'
swore, an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin'
ter th' 'ospital."

The boy faltered to an end.

"He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.
Thank you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited,
I am!"

She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.

"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"
she went on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't
have all these accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden
on me. Eh, dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last.
Put those things away, there's no time to be painting now. What time
is there a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.
I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'

I s'll have to leave that bedroom."

"I can finish it," said Paul.

"You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back,
I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion
he'll make! And those granite setts at Tinder Hill--he might
well call them kidney pebbles--they'll jolt him almost to bits.
I wonder why they can't mend them, the state they're in, an'
all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd
have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must
trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a
crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will!
I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar,
he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know.
Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and
WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad."

All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her
bodice, she crouched at the boiler
while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.

"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.
"You've time enough."

"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel
as she wiped her face.

"Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.
Should I come with you to Keston?"

"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have
I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt--and it's a blessing it
IS clean. But it had better be aired. And stockings--he won't want
them--and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"

"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father
had been in the hospital before.

"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey. "He's very particular
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."

Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces
of very thin bread and butter.

"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.

"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.

"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,"
he insisted.

So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.
She was thinking.

In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles
to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her
bulging string bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the
hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her,
that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she,
tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden
he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital,
she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is.
I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home again,
she felt he was coming to share her burden.

"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.

"It's bad enough," she replied.

"What?"

She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands
fingering at the bow under her chin.

"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse
says it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell
on his leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces
of bone sticking through---"

"Ugh--how horrid!" exclaimed the children.

"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die--it
wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,
looking at me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's
good for him,' said the Sister. She's an awfully nice Sister,
but rather strict."

Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.

"Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be.
It's a great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course,
it IS a very dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend
so easily. And then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took
bad ways he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man,
with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD
take bad ways. Of course there's a wound---"

She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house
was silent, anxious.

"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.

"That's what I tell him," said the mother.

Everybody moved about in silence.

"And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the
Sister says that is the pain."

Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.

"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll
have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.'
And he looked at me. It seems hard."

Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went
outside for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel,
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her
when the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned,
there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's pity was roused to its
full extent, when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse
him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain herself,
if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure
to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded
a while.

"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston,
I found I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them."
They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at
the toes. "I didn't know what to do with myself, for shame,"
she added.

In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel
talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.

"I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad,
poor little fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a
journey did you have with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.
'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But it WOR bad for him,
Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said. 'At ivry jolt
I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,' he said.
'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would
I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said.
I like Mr. Barker--I DO like him. There's something so manly
about him."

Paul resumed his task silently.

"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations.
And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it.
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed
four times a day, WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it?
He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll suffer in there with the nurses.
And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure, when I kissed him an' came away,
it seemed a shame."

So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking
aloud to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her
trouble to lighten it. And in the end she shared almost everything
with him without knowing.

Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a
critical condition. Then he began to mend. And then, knowing he
was going to get better, the whole family sighed with relief,
and proceeded to live happily.

They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings
from the sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund;
and then every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five
or seven shillings--so that she was quite well to do. And whilst
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was
extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband. Then she always
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send
them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood.
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.
Soon the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.
The girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her. Mrs. Morel
was full of information when she got home from Nottingham. The three
sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul
often raked the fire.

"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother
with joy. They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.
And they almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to
such callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and
light blue eyes. His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,
and was becoming somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost
rugged--and it was extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile,
like his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went
stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown
and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself
held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.

He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a
torture to him. But afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking
self-consciousness. He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years,
and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton
had taught him. But nothing he had was of any commercial value.
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his mother said.
He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred racing about,
or making excursions into the country, or reading, or painting.

"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.

"Anything."

"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.

But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.
His ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn
his thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home,
and then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother,
paint and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after. That was his
programme as far as doing things went. But he was proud within himself,
measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he
thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter, the real thing.
But that he left alone.

"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper
for the advertisements."

He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation
and an anguish to go through. But he said nothing. When he got up
in the morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:
