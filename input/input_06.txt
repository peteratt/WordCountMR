home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness

suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could

of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed

Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth

lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead

never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.

for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never

forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it

the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason

work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.

the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.

friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see

lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat

her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and

quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But

Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall

of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,

transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness

suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could

of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed

Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth

lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead

never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.

for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never

forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it

the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason

work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.

the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.

friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see

lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat

her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and

quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But

Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall

of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

"Look, dad!" he said.

"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly
lavish of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean
on the arm of Morel's chair and say:

"Tell us about down pit, daddy."

This Morel loved to do.

"Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"

Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel
Taffy's cunning.

"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.
Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.

"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'
some snuff?'

"An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead
on yer, that cadin'.

"'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."

"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.

"He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."

This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody
loved it.

Or sometimes it was a new tale.

"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

"'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.

"An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."

"And did you kill it?"

"I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."

"An' what do they live on?"

"The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an'
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--
the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."

These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel
had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,
often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him
to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed
the headlines of the newspaper.

And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.
They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights
went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung
in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,
made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling was
transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone any more:
the children suffered with her.

Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough
of twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter
came along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;
work was done. It was night.

Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone.
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting
on the table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,
waiting for the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,
some mile away from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.
Paul stood in the doorway.

"Has my dad come?" he asked.

"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the
futility of the question.

Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared
the same anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained
the potatoes.

"They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"

Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother
for suffering because his father did not come home from work.

"What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants
to stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"

"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."

She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a
quick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young,
and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But
the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay
on the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense
of anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it
any longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,
next door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children.
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.
So, when she saw the lad at the door, she called:

"Come in, Paul."

The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly
the boy rose, saying:

"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."

He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his
friend what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.

Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

"This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.

"Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.

And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his
arms on the table. Then he went to sleep.

Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,
with its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,
and the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,
paltry brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness
and nasty temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,
the man looked up and shouted:

"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha
doesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?"

And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,
usually at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.

He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the
day's happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in
them until it was told to their mother. But as soon as the father
came in, everything stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,
happy machinery of the home. And he was always aware of this fall
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.
But now it was gone too far to alter.

He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,
but they could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

"You ought to tell your father."

Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.
Everybody was highly jubilant.

"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,"
said Mrs. Morel. "You know how be carries on and says he's never
told anything."

"All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have
forfeited the prize than have to tell his father.

"I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.
Morel turned round to him.

"Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"

"Oh, nothing--about famous women."

"And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"

"It's a book."

"Oh, indeed! "

"About birds."

"Hm--hm! "

And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the
father and any other member of the family. He was an outsider.
He had denied the God in him.

The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people
was when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening,
he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then
he always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it.
They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,
when he was his real self again.

He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a
good humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years,
of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again.
It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into
the scullery, crying:

"Out of my road--out of my road!"

Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,
and made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,
soldering. Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank
suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute. He always
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering.
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his
moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do, considering them
too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.

But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a
stalk of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of
about six inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom
of each piece. He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could
cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set in the middle
of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black grains
upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see
the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth
of the straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full.
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he got on
his thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take
the nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,
imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they
went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing
tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.
The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason
for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day he came
home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it was not a family to make
any fuss.

"What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.

"Nothing," he replied.

But he ate no dinner.

"If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.

"Why?" he asked.

"That's why."

So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz
cushions the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze.
That afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,
restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rose
in her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She had
never expected him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body.
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.

He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of
the clatter of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,
thud on the ironing-board. Once roused, he opened his eyes to see
his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near
her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her still face,
with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue
eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love.
When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as
if she had been done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her that she had never had her life's fulfilment:
and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of
impotence, yet made him patiently dogged inside. It was his childish aim.

She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,
raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed
the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was
warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched
and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick.
It was always a pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,
no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by
her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen.
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.

Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not
mind much. What happened happened, and it was no good kicking
against the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,
