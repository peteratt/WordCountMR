even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they

wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.

confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence

Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.

and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.

Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all

was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,

of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,

where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,

and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.

that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,

decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,

one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she

broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through

but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.

and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at

very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!

half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.

relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.

had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,

And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared

Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,

he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill

can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,

turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.

in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make

in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,

in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on

It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.

said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch

fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,

struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,

rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the

of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,

There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill

the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never

Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating

Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella
was injured.

Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done
the damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.

"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.

She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,
made such a mountain of this molehill.

"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,"
he said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,
not even speak softly to him.

"Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence
along the road.

That same evening they were walking along under the trees
by Nether Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be
struggling to convince himself.

"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,
the other does."

"Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little,
'Love begets love.'"

"Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."

"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very
terrible thing," she said.

"Yes, but it IS--at least with most people," he answered.

And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong
in herself. She always regarded that sudden coming upon him
in the lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained
graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law.

Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,
she stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time she
dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came
again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
even the physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother
had always been. The slightest grossness made her recoil almost
in anguish. Her brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech.
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps,
because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes
on upon every farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter,
and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest
suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his pitch from her,
and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion.
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.

When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week,
but he was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough.
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone.
There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,
Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early,
whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o'clock the family heard
him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto
to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my darling". He
turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them
they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up,
and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody,
this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury.
The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.
There was a sense of plenty in the house.

While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:

"Paul! Paul! come and look!"

It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out.
There was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day,
with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which
rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel.
And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights
of the Pennine Chain.

Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared
among the young currant-bushes.

"Come here!" she cried.

"What for?" he answered.

"Come and see."

She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
Paul went up.

"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"

Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed,
was a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs,
and three scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at
the currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something
very blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you!
Sugar-bag! Three glories of the snow, and such beauties!
But where on earth did they come from?"

"I don't know," said Paul.

"Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed
and blade in this garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see,
that gooseberry-bush just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"

He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little
blue flowers.

"They're a glorious colour!" he said.

"Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland,
where they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here,
can they?"

Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash
of bulbs to mature.

"And you never told me," she said.

"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."

"And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."

She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was
an endless joy to her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last
to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering
about in it. And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.

Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they
set off, a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel
and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge
over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!"
said Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't
half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch
of these two magical places.

In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the
public-houses to open. It was a town of idleness and lounging.
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed. Over everything there were
great discussions. At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire
into Nottinghamshire. They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.

They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.
They found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,
"L. W." and "R. P.", in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted,
because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.

Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders
of yellow crocuses round the lawn.

"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"

She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she
looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all
these others; he was different then--not her Paul, who understood
the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,
speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened
her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her,
leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she
feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this garden,
wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field,
she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.
A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.

Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they
started home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not
fit in with the others; she could very rarely get into human
relations with anyone: so her friend, her companion, her lover,
was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the dusky,
cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed
the leaves; the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.

Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,
and she hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came
upon Paul, who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,
working away steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitated
in her approach, to watch.

He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make
him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,
as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold
of her, and she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,
discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.

At last he looked up.

"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"

She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.

"What is it?" she asked.

"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella

again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion
to Wingfield Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd.
They left the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the
street and in the colliers with their dogs. Here was a new race
of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the church.
They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,
went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds
of white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured
from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies
and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.
Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive
to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She
loved him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.
All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn to him.
He was a prayer along with her.

Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once
became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.

It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm
and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was
tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything
near the ruin, was perfect.

The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls
are blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went
in trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this
ruin might be denied them. In the first courtyard, within the high
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on
the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.
It was very still.

All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through
the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy.
Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree
was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were
in the shadow around them.

After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.
This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides
and expositors. There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,
as she climbed the hollow stairs.

"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism
like anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly."

"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.

"No, I don't. She was only lively."

They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,
and filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,
until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.
He did it perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.
She remembered this always.

Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,
old and handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,
in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,
