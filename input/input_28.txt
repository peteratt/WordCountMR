
"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,

incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she

rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.

He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd

He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,

checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.

to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,

She went very quiet.

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past

had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,

with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she

rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,

to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.

as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.

Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'

YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated

before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,

He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.

to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked

She sat and laughed.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never

"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,

incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,

He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,

like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd

He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.

to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.

She went very quiet.

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past

And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated

Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on

and her wrath rising,

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,

pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.

to her husband.

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

said Mrs. Morel.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she

rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,

to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.

as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.

Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'

YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated

before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,

He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.

to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked

She sat and laughed.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that

he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never

"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,

incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,

He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,

like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd

He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.
Then Barker glanced at the checks.

Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back
to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing.
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;
each half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling
till there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the end
that wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.

Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house
before his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended.
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on
the table, she saw her money lying. Paul had been working all
the time. But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,
and her wrath rising,

"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.

He frowned. He could not work when she was cross.
She counted again.

"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much
was the cheque?"

"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what
was coming.

"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'
his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because
YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer.
No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!"

"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.

"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.

"Don't carry on again. I can't work."

She went very quiet.

"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think
I'm going to manage?"

"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."

"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put
up with."

"It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."

He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.
When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began
to insist on her recognizing him.

"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done
in twenty minutes. Don't forget them."

"All right," he answered; and she went to market.

He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration
became unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.

"All alone?" she said.

"Yes."

As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,
his and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."

She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

It irritated him that she peered so into everything that
was his, searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned
with a bundle of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,
he spread it on the floor. It proved to be a curtain or portiere,
beautifully stencilled with a design on roses.

"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,"
said Mrs. Morel.

Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.

"Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.
My bones fair juts out on me."

"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.

"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."

Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,
muscular, without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear.
It might have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that
there were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.
But he put his hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,
because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.
Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and the
incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.

"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."

"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,
like a child.

"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself
up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could."

"Me!" exclaimed Morel--"me a good figure! I wor niver much
more n'r a skeleton."

"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"

"'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked
as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."

She sat and laughed.

"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never
a man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You should
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul,
drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.

Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she
had had for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,
rather scared, and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow.
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years.
He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.

"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.

His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it
on his shoulders. He gave a jump.

"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"

"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed,
washing his back. It was very rarely she would do anything
so personal for him. The children did those things.

"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.

"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."

But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,
and went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,
with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put on.
He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.

"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"

"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd
as a tub o' water?" he said.

At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.
He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie
and her familiar friends had been present.

Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped
it into a tin. As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered.
He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he would go
through a stone wall. His black hair was cropped short, his head
was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.

"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated
himself with a sigh.

"Good-evening," she replied cordially.

"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.

"I dunno as I have," said Barker.

He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,
effacing himself rather.

"How's missis?" she asked of him.

He had told her some time back:

"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."

"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty
middlin', I think."

"Let's see--when?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."

"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"

"Yes, tidy."

"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."

"No. An' I've done another silly trick."

"What's that?"

Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."

"You can have mine."

"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."

"I shan't. I take a string bag always."

She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said
to her husband.

Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,
despite his seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.

"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.

"Yes," replied Barker.

The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.
His nose was pointed and red.

"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.

"It's a bit nippy," he replied.

"Then come to the fire."

"Nay, I s'll do where I am."

Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come
on to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

"Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.

"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."

"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.

He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly.
It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.

"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.

He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.

"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.

"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.

"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you
have that flannel singlet made?"

"Not yet," he smiled.

"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.

"It'll come," he smiled.

"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.

Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,
they were both as hard as nails, physically.

When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.

"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.

Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag
upside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,
sovereigns and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the
checks--the written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order.

to the hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of them
counted the money.

"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount
was put aside.

"An' Bill Naylor's?"

This money also was taken from the pack.

Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,
and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each.
And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,
