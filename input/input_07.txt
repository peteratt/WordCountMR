when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

a love-token.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all

and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.

was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry

been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly

train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,

Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures

and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.

the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking

as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could

Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at

unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

a love-token.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all

and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.

was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry

been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly

train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,

Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures

and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.

the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking

as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could

Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at

unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

a love-token.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all

and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.

was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry

been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly

train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,

Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures

and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.

the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking

as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could

Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at

unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.

"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.

"Morel--Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger
and thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.

Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could
not or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him.
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.

"He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"

The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.
He pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,
and disclosed the boy.

"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.

Paul went to the counter.

"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you
shout up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged
on to the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate
and pretty movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,
and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright stream
over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the money;
the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he
suffered again.

"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.

The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some
loose silver and half a sovereign.

"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.

The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the
faintest notion.

"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"

Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.

"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.

"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.

Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he
got his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures
of the damned on these occasions.

His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the
Mansfield Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green.
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple
trees of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream.
The boy went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,
but could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new
torture to him.

When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not
yet come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly
to grown men. "Sit you down."

Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.
Some colliers were "reckoning"--sharing out their money--in a corner;
others came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking.
At last Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in
his blackness.

"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me?
Shall you have a drink of something?"

Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,
and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all
the men than in having a tooth drawn.

The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.
Paul went home, glowering. He entered the house silently.
Friday was baking day, and there was usually a hot bun. His mother
put it before him.

when the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.

On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the
atmosphere for the boy.

"Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.

"No; is my mother comin'?"

"She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?"
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.

"I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"

"Not long, my duckie."

The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment
or two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top
of the stairs and said to his wife:

"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"

"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."

"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently
to Paul.

"Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.

"He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.

"Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs.
There's the other children---"

Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.
He loved a fire dearly.

"She says she won't be long," he said.

He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish
with irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all
his sick impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking
at his son awhile, said softly:

"Good-night, my darling."

"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.
The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from
the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body
and soul completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,
and got better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on
into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith.

In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy
horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay
on the trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,
black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field.
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.

In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass.
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,
like pigeons dashing by. Away across the valley the little black
train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.

While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they
could do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,
for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in
the green. And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy:
there was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting something
straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing to
the family exchequer.

But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,
was the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured
the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry
was to be found, every week-end going on their search. In that
region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity.
But Paul hunted far and wide. He loved being out in the country,
among the bushes. But he also could not bear to go home to his
mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he would
have died rather.

"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in,
late, and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"

"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over
Misk Hills. And look here, our mother!"

She peeped into the basket.

"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.

"And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds"?

She tried the basket.

"Yes," she answered doubtfully.

Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her
one spray, the best he could find.

"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting
a love-token.

The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than
own himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never
realised this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waited
for her children to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.

But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at
home, the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.
At the same time, they were good friends.

Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule
that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers
of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,
as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the
public-house or in his own home. So that the children could
fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.
Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched
the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.
Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag
in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men
were seen trooping to the offices.

These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of
Greenhill Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early.
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There
was a sound of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats.
The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
The green shrubs were silent all around.

Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park--Spinney Park."
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time
for Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room
was quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half.
Behind the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,
Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the stern
patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.
No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats
of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were
not witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions
against the colliers.

The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had
been home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually
a dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed
behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him.
He knew the order of the names--they went according to stall number.

"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

"Bower--John Bower."

A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him over his spectacles.

"John Bower!" he repeated.

"It's me," said the boy.

"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered,
thinking of John Bower senior.

"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite,
in a large and magisterial voice.

"He's badly," piped the boy.

"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the
great cashier.

"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking
voice from behind.

All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked
down at his next sheet.

"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.

Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.
He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning.
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.

"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.
