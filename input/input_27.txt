"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.

opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would

him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild

tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the

him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off

he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,

not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,

So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could

it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.

to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.

her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave

going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.

him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off

he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.

You know it's only friendship."

the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.

him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more

some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,

saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off

he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

You know it's only friendship."

loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,

to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,

fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did

as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the

saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an

A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.

the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely

She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;

that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought

saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off

he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an

A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown

unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.

Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.

wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.

It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought

hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel

as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the

saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to

the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an

A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown

unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.

at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
"Yes."

He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:

"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."

She did not answer.

"You don't mind?"

Still she did not answer.

"Do you?" he asked.

"You know whether I mind or not."

"I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."

"You do."

"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"

"I begrudge whom tea?"

"What are you so horrid for?"

"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.
She'll come."

He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely
Miriam she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.

Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad
to see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat
in her black dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors.
With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging.
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.

He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have
gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home.
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.
The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.
He was never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam
of hers, because both were what they should be, and warm.
And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty,
the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not
silver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice.
Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up,
so that nothing was out of place.

Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic.
But Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,
like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end;
and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home.
It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,
and flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places ever
since he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit
there for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,
uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship.
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once. And after
chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest
of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam.
He never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house,
the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning
slowly like shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him,
keen and almost unbearable.

She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took
one for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,
opposite the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel
the Leivers's pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she would
not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,
her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet.
Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gave
him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,
to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,
that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he could not get to.

At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning
to dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it.
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriam
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had
her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when they
went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul.
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.

"She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,"
Mrs. Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not
like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.
She wants to absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorb
him till there is nothing left of him, even for himself.
He will never be a man on his own feet--she will suck him up."
So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild
with torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,
going at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for
some minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness
fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,
and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.
It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?
He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought
of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he
hated her--and he easily hated her. Why did she make him feel
as if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing,
as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the
space breaking into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush
of tenderness and humility!

Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother
saw on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.
But he had to make her talk to him. Then she was angry with him
for going so far with Miriam.

"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.

"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've
tried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!"

And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense
and cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came the
hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched
him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could
do nothing. It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards
Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.
And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.

One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam
sitting beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole
along on the water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,
cold blue. Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.
He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,
and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to give
her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy
she drew into herself through some channel which united them.
She did not want to meet him, so that there were two of them,
man and woman together. She wanted to draw all of him into her.
It urged him to an intensity like madness, which fascinated him,
as drug-taking might.

He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,
as she heard him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end
it frightened her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,
almost inhuman, as if in a trance.

"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand
on his forehead.

He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was
somewhere discarded.

"Why not? Are you tired?"

"Yes, and it wears you out."

He laughed shortly, realising.

"Yet you always make me like it," he said.

"I don't wish to," she said, very low.

"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.
But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I
want it."

He went on, in his dead fashion:

"If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off
for you! "


"I!" she cried bitterly--"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"

"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,
he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial.
In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to
blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.

One evening about this time he had walked along the home road
with her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,
unable to part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They had
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.
His jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with
difficulty through the spume of cloud.

Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,
until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars.
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just
an ordinary constellation to him. He had fought against his glamour
and fascination. Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully.
But he said nothing that gave him away, till the moment came to part,
when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which
the great constellation must be striding still.

There was to be a little party at his house the next day,
at which she was to attend.

"I shan't come and meet you," he said.

"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.

"It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care
more for you than for them. And you understand, don't you?
You know it's only friendship."

Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an
effort. She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.
She was hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown
about by any wind of authority. And in her heart of hearts,
unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away from her.
This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.

At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse.
Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul
remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson.
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at
the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they both
loved to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,
and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.

Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.
Morel "reckoned"--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.

Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.
She was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.
Paul was studying design.

Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the
week's earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,
prepared to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent
themselves while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy
into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they
to know the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her
father was spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spend
an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.

"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.

Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.

"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy
jaw rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul
and the mother frowned to hear him.

Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.

"Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"

It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he
would have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.

"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.

"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.
"It's NOT cold."

"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"

"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.

"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'
thy nesh sides."

"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.

"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.
"But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through
your ribs like through a five-barred gate."
