"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,

below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters

and a brewer's waggoner."

and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all

and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away

law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she

and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still

Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would

know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,

elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along

of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up

on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."

was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.

and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had

and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along

and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system

and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of

"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had

and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such

"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.

and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system

monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,

then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,

paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such

rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated

written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws

he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be

throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,

and a brewer's waggoner."

and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."

to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind

and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away

and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still

Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would

taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.

rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,

And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up

to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."

old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he

rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."

of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away

law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still

Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would

grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his

as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.

and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had

and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along

and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system

and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."

It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all
joy and even life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.

And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be
a queer, quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town,
he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going
to the Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.
He can't get a job. I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he
crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op.,
and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were there,
either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he entered,
full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at
the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would think:
"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of

"What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a newspaper?"
and he suffered.

Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was
a prisoner of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the
old red wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way
down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner.
The valley was full of corn, brightening in the sun. Two collieries,
among the fields, waved their small white plumes of steam. Far off
on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.
Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.

The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner,
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much
below Paul's eye. The man's hair, on his small, bullet head,
was bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms,
rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The horses,
handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters
of the show.

Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself,
"I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig
and a brewer's waggoner."

Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy
an advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip
out in immense relief. His mother would scan over his copies.

"Yes," she said, "you may try."

William had written out a letter of application, couched in
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all
things well, got into a fever of impatience.

The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found
that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends
in station. Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law,
and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.
William always made friends among men wherever he went, he was so jolly.
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who,
in Bestwood, would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager,
and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector. So he began
to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed, rather surprised
at the ease with which he became a gentleman.

His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging
in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind
of fever into the young man's letters. He was unsettled by all
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin
rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was
anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced
and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends;
and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away
at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the
law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now.
It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she
did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner,
and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still
dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him.
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious
her heart was because of him.

Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men
were running thick and fast.

"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote
to him, "unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd. But take care,
and see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."
William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had
taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her, mother, you would
know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such
grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you,
your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down
Piccadilly with him."

Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes,
rather than with a woman who was near to him. But she congratulated
him in her doubtful fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub,
the mother brooded over her son. She saw him saddled with an
elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.
"But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly--meeting
trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever
left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.

Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.
Mrs. Morel was all joy.

"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only
written four letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky,
my boy, as I always said you were."

Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system
of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed
monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.
It was August and blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up
tight inside him. He would have suffered much physical pain rather
than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,
to be accepted or rejected. Yet he chattered away with his mother.
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things,
and she only partly guessed. She was gay, like a sweetheart.
She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood, and Paul watched
her take from her purse the money for the tickets.
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting
the silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain
of love of her.

She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she
WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.

"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round
as if it thought it was a circus."

"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.

"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.

They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having
her opposite him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to
him--a rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.
Then each looked out of the window.

The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers
having an adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine
on the water that lay between high factory walls.

"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.

They enjoyed the shops immensely.

"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"

"And made of needlework as well," he said.

"Yes."

They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town
was strange and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside
in a knot of apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle. It was
gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house
doors with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting
on to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window looked
like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and son went cautiously,
looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It was like hunting
in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.

Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names
of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"

They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory,
on the other a Commercial Hotel.

"It's up the entry," said Paul.

And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws
of the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well,
with buildings all round. It was littered with straw and boxes,
and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw
was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place
was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.
Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase,
loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I mounted his
scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his
mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front
of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about
in an at-home sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream
parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood.
All was quiet and very homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward,
then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had on her Sunday
bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar and a
Norfolk suit.

One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a
small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round
to the other end of the room, where was a glass office. And then
he came forward. He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle,
inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.

"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.

"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.

He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered
old man looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.
Then the same little man came up the room. He had short legs,
was rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up,
as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.

"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel,
in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.

"Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him
to call this morning."

"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little
manner intended to be businesslike.

They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of
many customers. On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather
hoops tangled together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the
odour of new wash-leather. He wondered what the things were. By this
time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things.

"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel
to a horse-hair chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.

"Yes," he answered.

At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter;
second, in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay
on the kitchen table. It was like part of himself, gone astray.
He resented the way the man held it.

"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.

Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.

"He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.
Then she pushed up her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder
with this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.

"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man,
still sharply.

"Yes," said Paul.

"What school did you go to?"

"The Board-school."

"And did you learn it there?"

"No--I---" The boy went crimson and got no farther.

"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading
and rather distant.

Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner--he always
seemed to keep his hands ready for action--he pulled another sheet of
paper from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise.
He handed it to Paul.

"Read that," he said.

It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting
that the boy could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.

"'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion
